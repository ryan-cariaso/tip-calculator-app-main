## My process

This project took me about 9 hours because of how new I was. I first started with just writing the html code out. I made sure I had all the elements on the page first before I even started styling it. Once I completed all the HTML coding, I began styling starting from the top and then the left column and then the right column. The styling of the left column was much easier because of the use of inputs. However, the styling of the left column was a lot harder for me. Once I finished all the styling and the page looked as similar as possible, I gave a crack at the programming side of the project. It did not go well but I am hoping to learn how to complete it soon!

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript


### What I learned

My main focus for this project was replicating the design as closely as possible. I am a new front end developer so I was using this to test my ability to learn on the spot without a tutorial. It helped me a lot with visually looking at the picture and figuring out the HTML and CSS code from scratch. I used to not be able to know where to begin with projects and now I can look and immediately understand what needs to be done. I am not too good at Javascript so unfortunately that part of the project is unfinished. I did attempt the programming part of it but it was too difficult for me. I also had trouble making the website responsive. I am hoping to see some of the other solutions to be able to get an idea of how the script should be written.

### Continued development

As stated above, I am not good at programming. I do plan to continue developing this project so I can finish the app completely. I want to figure out the Javascript part and make the website fully responsive so this can be a fully complete app.
